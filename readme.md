# PROGRAMMING PROJECT: CAR WEB APP

Simple app which can and will possibly be developed further.

This is a very simple (hopefuly not broken) web app constructed in Python and hosted on Python Anywhere.

further implementation can concern:
* multilogin ?
* create relationship table of cars and users - Who searched what license plate?
* clean up of useless code
* implementation of 'good practices' within Flask architecture
* Search by VIN number
* Database redisign on models.py
* Notifications
* ideas that don't fall into the proof-of-concept prototype
