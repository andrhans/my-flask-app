# PROGRAMMING PROJECT: CAR WEB APP

Simple app which can and will possibly be developed further.

This is a very simple (hopefuly not broken) web app constructed in Python and hosted on Python Anywhere.

further implementation can concern:
* create relationship between table of cars and users - Who searched what license plate?
* clean up of useless code
* implementation of 'good practices' within Flask architecture
* search by VIN number
* database redesign on models.py ?
* notifications
* further implementation of API call with advanced parameters
* Utilization of cursors to handle queries easier?
    * https://realpython.com/prevent-python-sql-injection/
* ideas that don't fall into the proof-of-concept prototype
